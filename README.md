## How it was Written using Copilot
Copilot, an AI programming assistant, was used to help write the code for this game. Copilot provided suggestions and auto-completions for various programming tasks, such as generating random sets of letters, validating word inputs, and calculating scores. It greatly accelerated the development process and ensured the code was efficient and error-free.

To play the game, simply run the main script and follow the instructions on the screen. Have fun and enjoy the Spelling Bee Clone!

## words from the author
I like to play spellingbee everyday, but I don't want to pay for it. The paywall stops the game at about half the possible points, leaving me to wonder how far I could have gone. 
I was also curious how to use Copilot, so these two things just came together very nicely. Copilot took over a lot of manual typing, and also took over parts I'm not very familiar with (like the fdopen and getline function). With this kind of support it took just a rainy morning to have the base game running :)
